* **Mobile Apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android Devices (free):** Chat via your mobile device or tablet by using our iPhone/iPad or Android apps!

* **Desktop Apps for Windows & Mac machines (free):** Chat via our dedicated desktop apps instead of our web dashboard to get online even faster.

* **Custom Branding, Colors, & Themes (free):** Customize your chat widgets to match your site's brand. Change the color of the chat button/widget, chat message and font color, backgrounds, etc. Upload your own online and offline live chat images to use in your header, footer, etc. to encourage customers to live chat!

* **Multi-Language Support and Custom Text (free):** Customize the text of your chat button/widget in any language of your choice! Easily customize the English text or modify it to read in Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, French, Polish, Chinese, Indonesian, and many more!

* **Popup Library (free with tiered limits):**  Popup Library with dozens of professionally designed marketing popups. Multiple display types including lightbox/modals, corner widgets, and website bars.  Announce a special sale, offer a coupon code, or market virtually anything to your visitors.

* **Real-time Visitor Monitoring:** See the number of active visitors on your website in real-time, and initiate live chats with them.  View the visitor's country, recently viewed web pages, referring site (e.g. did they come from a Google search, etc.), are they a new user vs. returning, IP address, operating system in use (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, etc.), internet browser, and more. Live Chat visitor monitoring is a paid feature and comes with our Professional package or higher.

* **Custom Chatbots:** Chatbots work around the clock to automatically qualify leads, book meetings, and provide information about your products or services to customers, even without having to chat with a live person! Chatbots can be added to any Premium package as a paid feature add-on.  Check out our [Custom Chat Bot](https://www.formilla.com/blog/how-to-create-custom-chat-bots "Custom Chat Bot") tutorial to learn more.

* **A.I. Chatbots:** Formilla Chat bots allow customers to dramatically reduce support time by setting up a Chatbot that automatically responds to common visitor questions at any time -- day or night -- using the power of Artificial Intelligence (paid feature add-on).  Check out our [Helper Chat Bot](https://www.formilla.com/blog/getting-started-with-a-helper-chat-bot "Helper Chat Bot") tutorial to learn more.

* **Pro-active Chat:** Enable pro-active chat to trigger automatically after a defined number of seconds (Premium packages). You can also configure a chatbot to do the same, with even more control over the user flow. For example, a chatbot can proactively popup to engage visitors and qualify them as leads before speaking with a live agent. This works with multiple types of custom chatbots you can create for your business.


= Example use cases for Buttonizer =

* <strong>The Buttonizer advantage</strong>. Buttonizer gives you the ability to manage different chat options at the same time. Each visitor is unique, and has a different communication preference. When you let your visitors chat with you using chat apps like Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram, etc, they have the freedom of chatting with you however they prefer, which increases engagement with your website.

* <strong>Launch your favorite live chat </strong>. While Formilla comes directly integrated, you can use JavaScript as one of your click actions to launch any other live chat product such as Hubspot, Tawk.to, Tidio, Chatra, Zoho, Zendesk, LiveChat, Crisp, Intercom and JivoChat.

* <strong>Connect with your visitors on WhatsApp Business</strong>. Connect WhatsApp Business to your site. Your visitors can start chatting with you on WhatsApp Business.

* <strong>Setup different floating buttons on mobile and desktop </strong>. Show different chat buttons depending on the device where your visitor is using. Like show a call now and WhatsApp button on mobile and a contact form, email and url on desktop.

= Example use cases for Live Chat =

There are a variety of reasons you might be interested in adding a live chat feature to your site. Most commonly, site owners are looking to chat in real-time with visitors in order to offer better customer service or to generate sales.

= Live Chat for Customer Service =

Data from ecommerce platform Shopify shows that “businesses that respond to a customer’s chat within five minutes are 69% more likely to get a sale.” Customers don’t like hunting around for information or waiting for responses, and live chat offers the best possible customer experience. A live chat customer service agent can speak directly to a customer, providing a personal experience leading to increased customer satisfaction.

One of the benefits of live chat that businesses often overlook is the ability to learn directly from customers. Speaking to a customer who came to your site looking to solve a problem or answer a question gives you valuable insight into how real people interact with your website. Live chat customer service also helps keep customer interactions on-site, rather than seeing frustrated customers take their complaints to a public forum like social media.


= Live Chat for Marketing =

Live chat can help in multiple ways throughout the purchase funnel for your business. Talking to real human beings is one of the ways we are all most comfortable learning about new products and services, and a skilled marketer communicating to site visitors via a live chat widget can provide great opportunities to educate and engage potential customers.

A live chat widget is an effective way to increase your visitor-to-lead conversion rate. By engaging potential customers right away, you’re reducing the number of visitors who “bounce” off your site. And you can also use live chat to pre-qualify leads, determining a visitor’s actual interest level in what you have to offer.


= Live Chat for Sales =

Using live chat to help convert site visitors into customers is often referred to as “conversational sales.” Your live chat sales team can help visitors find the products or services they are looking for quickly, can nurture leads brought to the site by marketing programs, and can answer ordering or billing questions as needed to offer a smooth transaction experience.

Live chat is also a great opportunity for a sales agent to schedule a product demonstration or training session, which can be especially helpful for sites that provide things like business software. And agents can also encourage satisfied customers to share their contact information as part of the chat, in order to continue the personalized interaction in the future.

= How can live chat bots help businesses? =

The uses of live chat bots on business websites are varied, but can be broadly categorized into customer service, marketing, and sales tasks. Automated chat bots can staff the live chat feature on your site when live chat agents aren’t available. The flexibility provided by custom bots makes them an efficient solution for handling common sales and support tasks, while freeing up your team to handle more complex inquiries. For example, you can configure multiple bots across your website based on key landing pages, learn where visitors are at in the sales process by asking them questions and collecting input, and perform specific actions based on visitor selection.

Some of the popular chat bot use cases include:

* **Triage:** A live chat bot can greet site visitors and ask them to choose from several pre-defined answer buttons to guide them down a given path, similar to an automated phone system.  For example, the bot can show options such as ‘I’m new & want to learn more’, ‘Track my order’, ‘Change my password’, ‘Technical help’, along with ‘Other’ if nothing matches the reason for their visit, along with a multitude of other button options based on your business needs.

* **Lead Qualification:** To collect contact information from site visitors as a means to generate leads, and ask additional qualifying questions to determine the size of the opportunity, gauge the customer’s interest and where they are at in the buying cycle, or route them right to your sales team or even book a demo on your calendar.

* **Scheduling:** With the Calendly scheduling feature, a live chat bot can be configured to display your Calendly calendar directly inside the live chat widget for the visitor to choose from any available dates and times for a demo or phone consultation.

* **Frequently Asked Questions:** A custom menu-based bot can be used to preemptively answer frequently asked questions from site visitors.  For example, let’s say you have a conference event coming up and configure a live chat bot with pre-defined buttons where the visitor can quickly choose from topics such as ticket costs, directions to the event, parking tips, event schedule, guest speakers participating, nearby hotels, and more.  This can work for a virtual conference as well.

* **Helper Bot:** A Helper Bot dramatically reduces support time by automatically responding to common visitor questions at any time -- day or night -- using the power of Artificial Intelligence. A Helper Bot is different from the other bot types since it allows visitors to enter a free-form question, and replies with the most relevant answer based on how it has been trained over time.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is a Floating Action Button and why should I use it? =

A floating action button is a button that 'floats' on the right corner of your website.

Maybe you noticed already that a lot of applications (mobile and web) have their primary floating action button (FAB), on the right corner of their website or app. You see this a lot with chat funtions. The Floating Action Button is becoming a standard in application and webdesign. Webvisitors are getting more and more used to the fact that there is a floating action button which is the primary action you can make on that page, on the right corner of a website.

The Buttonizer is a new way to give a boost to your number of interactions, actions and conversions from your website visitor by adding a Customizable Smart Multifunctional Floating Button in the corner of your website.

= What's the difference between floating action buttons or other conversion buttons? =

With Buttonizer you don't just add the same button to every page on your website. No, the key is that each action must be relevant. With the Buttonizer it's possible to add buttons to a select number of pages with "page rules", decide for each button if it shows on mobile and/or desktop, style your button with your own icons & colors, add social sharing buttons, Show the button on opening hours and make use of many more rules.

And the beauty of all: All actions are hidden in one button. The moment a visitor clicks on your Floating Action Button it will *pop* all specific buttons you've set for that page. Track each single button in Google Analytics so you can see which actions your visitors prefer.

In fact, Buttonizer is an addiction to use. Your website visitors will interact as never before.

= Which buttons are available with Buttonizer? =
WhatsApp chat, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Email, SMS, Snapchat, X (Twitter), LinkedIn, Skype, Vkontakte, Phone (click to call), Telegram, Line, WeChat, Viber, Waze, Zalo, Google Maps, Poptin, Custom URL, Page Select.

= What widgets does Buttonizer support? =

We have the following widgets natively integrated:
- WhatsApp widget
- Facebook Messenger widget
- Contact form (PRO: integrated Webhook support)
- Iframe widget (PRO)

Customize their position and visibility wherever you need. With the iframe widget you are able to show YouTube video's, integrate Calendly or any other page or website.

You can also interact with widgets using the Widget JavaScript API.

= I don’t see the button on my site, what should I do? =
Please make sure you’ve chosen at least one button and clicked on the green “Publish” button. If you still don't see any changes on the live site, you can clear the cache of your website if you have a caching plugin.

= How can I add a WhatsApp chat popup? =
Download the wordpress plugin, choose the WhatsApp templates, change your phone number, change the text and there you go. You can also choose the WhatsApp widget option to add a popup window. Don’t forget to enter the WhatsApp number with country code
E.g.
country code +1
number: 6123456789
** WhatsApp number: 16123456789 **

= Can I add multiple floating action buttons with the free version? =
Yes you can. You can make an unlimited amount of buttons and groups in Buttonizer.

= Does Buttonizer work on mobile? =
Yes, you can choose for each button if you want to display the button on mobile, desktop or both.

= Does Buttonizer support right-to-left languages? =
Languages can have a different direction of writing and reading? While languages such as English are written and read from left to right, other languages might follow the right-to-left style of script. Just considering the sheer number of language speakers, it is obvious that Buttonizer could not stay behind and has made sure to reserve the layout of the user interface to support right-to-left languages.
